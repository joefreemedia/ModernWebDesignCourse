		<strong>Social media</strong> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication" target="_blank">computer-mediated</a> technologies that allow the creating and sharing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" target="_blank">information</a>, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition. However, there are some common features.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[1]</a></sup>

			<li>Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1" class="hover_pop">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-Kaplan-2" class="hover_pop">[2]</a></sup></li>
			<li>User-generated content, such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through all online interactions, are the lifeblood of social media.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1" class="hover_pop">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-Kaplan-2" class="hover_pop">[2]</a></sup></li>
			<li>Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1" class="hover_pop">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-boydEllison-3" class="hover_pop">[3]</a></sup></li>
			<li>Social media facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals and/or groups.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1" class="hover_pop">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-boydEllison-3" class="hover_pop">[3]</a></sup></li>

		Social media use <em>web-based technologies</em>, desktop computers and mobile technologies (e.g., smartphones and tablet computers) to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content or pre-made content posted online. They introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between businesses, organizations, communities and individuals.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[4]</a></sup> Social media changes the way individuals and large organizations communicate. These changes are the focus of the emerging field of technoself studies. In America, a survey reported that 84<abbr title="percent" aria-label="percent">%</abbr> of adolescents in America have a Facebook account.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[5]</a></sup> Over 60<abbr title="percent" aria-label="percent">%</abbr> of 13 to 17-year-olds have at least one profile on social media, with many spending more than two hours a day on social networking sites.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[6]</a></sup> According to <cite class="journal">Nielsen</cite>, Internet users continue to spend more time on social media sites than on any other type of site. At the same time, the total time spent on social media sites in the U.S. across PCs as well as on mobile devices increased by 99<abbr title="percent" aria-label="percent">%</abbr> to 121 billion minutes in <time datetime="2012-07">July 2012</time> compared to 66 billion minutes in <time datetime="2011-07">July 2011</time>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[7]</a></sup> For content contributors, the benefits of participating in social media have gone beyond simply social sharing to building reputation and bringing in career opportunities and monetary income.<sup><a href="#cite_note-SMDefinition-1">[8]</a></sup>
